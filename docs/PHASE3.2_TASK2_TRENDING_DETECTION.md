# Phase 3.2 - Task 2: Enhanced Trending Detection - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview
**Task**: Create trending topic detection algorithms  
**Priority**: üî¥ P1-CRITICAL  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `phase-3.2-crawler-agent`  
**Commits**: ef6c640, 5540f5c  

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

### 1. Advanced Trending Detection Service
Created `src/services/analytics/trendingService.js` (612 lines) with sophisticated algorithms:

**Velocity Scoring** (40% weight)
- Calculates mentions per hour in short window (1 hour)
- Compares with medium window (4 hours) for acceleration factor
- Normalizes velocity with acceleration boost for rapidly rising topics
- Example: "AI" topic achieved 7.0 mentions/hour velocity

**Multi-Factor Scoring System**
- Velocity (40%): How fast mentions are increasing
- Volume (30%): Total number of mentions (normalized 0-1)
- Recency (20%): How recent the mentions are
- Credibility (10%): Average source credibility score
- Combined weighted trend score determines ranking

**Lifecycle Tracking**
- Monitors velocity changes over time to determine stage:
  - **Emerging**: Rapidly rising (+50%+ velocity change)
  - **Rising**: Gaining momentum (+10% to +50%)
  - **Peak**: Stable popularity (-10% to +10%)
  - **Declining**: Losing momentum (-10% to -50%)
  - **Fading**: Rapidly declining (-50%+ velocity drop)
- Includes confidence scores and velocity change percentages

**Topic Clustering**
- Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm for similarity calculation
- Groups related keywords (e.g., "technology", "tech")
- Configurable similarity threshold (default 0.6)
- Limits cluster size to prevent over-grouping (default 10)

**Time Distribution Analysis**
- Tracks mentions across multiple windows:
  - Last 1 hour (short-term trends)
  - Last 4 hours (medium-term trends)
  - Last 24 hours (daily trends)
- Enables acceleration detection and recency scoring

**Trend History Tracking**
- Maintains historical data for each keyword (last 24 data points)
- Enables lifecycle stage determination through comparison
- Automatic cleanup of stale topics (> 24 hours old)

### 2. CrawlerAgent Integration
Enhanced `src/agents/specialized/CrawlerAgent.js`:

**Configuration Updates**
- Replaced simple trending threshold with comprehensive `trendingConfig` object
- All trending parameters now configurable (weights, windows, thresholds)
- Supports keyword extraction for short acronyms (min length 2 for "AI", "UK", etc.)

**detectTrendingTopics() Method**
- Now uses TrendingService for advanced analysis
- Returns topics with velocity, trend scores, lifecycle stages
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy trending topics map
- Adds analytics summary (avg velocity, avg trend score, lifecycle distribution)

**getLifecycleDistribution() Method**
- New method to analyze distribution of lifecycle stages
- Provides insight into trending topic maturity across system

**Updated Statistics**
- `getCrawlerStats()` now includes TrendingService metrics
- Reports tracked topics, clusters, and configuration
- `cleanup()` method clears trend history on shutdown

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `scripts/test-trending-detection.js` (508 lines) with 7 test scenarios:

‚úÖ **Test 1: Basic Trending Detection**
- Validates topic extraction and scoring
- Confirms all scoring factors working
- Result: 7 topics detected from 16 articles

‚úÖ **Test 2: Velocity Scoring**
- Verifies recent topics have higher velocity than old topics
- Tests raw velocity vs normalized velocity
- Result: AI topic achieved 7.0 mentions/hour

‚úÖ **Test 3: Credibility Scoring**
- Ensures high credibility sources boost scores
- Tests that low credibility sources (0.30) don't dominate
- Result: AI topic credibility score 0.877 (excellent)

‚úÖ **Test 4: Lifecycle Tracking**
- Confirms all topics receive lifecycle stages
- Validates confidence scores and descriptions
- Result: All topics correctly classified as "emerging"

‚úÖ **Test 5: Topic Clustering**
- Tests similarity-based clustering algorithm
- Validates cluster formation and ranking
- Result: 10 clusters identified from trending topics

‚úÖ **Test 6: Time Window Filtering**
- Verifies recency scoring works correctly
- Confirms time distribution tracking
- Result: 6 topics with high recency scores (> 0.7)

‚úÖ **Test 7: Similarity Calculation**
- Tests Levenshtein distance algorithm
- Validates similarity scores are in valid range (0-1)
- Result: All similarity calculations valid

**Test Results**: 7/7 tests passing (100%)

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### Velocity Calculation Algorithm
```
short_window = 1 hour
medium_window = 4 hours

mentions_short = count(mentions in last hour)
mentions_medium = count(mentions in last 4 hours)

raw_velocity = mentions_short / 1  # mentions per hour
medium_velocity = mentions_medium / 4

acceleration = raw_velocity / medium_velocity  # > 1 means accelerating
normalized_velocity = min((raw_velocity * acceleration) / 5, 1)
```

### Trend Score Calculation
```
trend_score = 
    (velocity_normalized * 0.4) +
    (volume_score * 0.3) +
    (recency_score * 0.2) +
    (credibility_score * 0.1)

where:
- velocity_normalized: 0-1 (from velocity calculation)
- volume_score: min(mentions / 10, 1)
- recency_score: max(0, 1 - avg_age / medium_window)
- credibility_score: avg(source_credibilities)
```

### Levenshtein Distance (for clustering)
Dynamic programming algorithm that calculates edit distance between strings:
- Substitution, insertion, and deletion operations
- O(n*m) time complexity where n, m are string lengths
- Similarity = 1 - (distance / max_length)

## üîß Configuration Options

All trending parameters are configurable:

```javascript
const trendingConfig = {
  minMentions: 3,              // Minimum mentions to be trending
  minVelocity: 0.5,            // Minimum velocity (mentions/hour)
  shortWindow: 3600000,        // 1 hour (milliseconds)
  mediumWindow: 14400000,      // 4 hours
  longWindow: 86400000,        // 24 hours
  velocityWeight: 0.4,         // 40% weight
  volumeWeight: 0.3,           // 30% weight
  recencyWeight: 0.2,          // 20% weight
  credibilityWeight: 0.1,      // 10% weight
  similarityThreshold: 0.6,    // 60% similarity for clustering
  maxClusterSize: 10,          // Max topics per cluster
  minKeywordLength: 2,         // Allow "AI", "UK" etc.
  maxKeywordLength: 20,
};
```

## üìà Performance Characteristics

**Computational Complexity**:
- Article processing: O(n * k) where n = articles, k = avg keywords per article
- Trend scoring: O(t) where t = unique topics
- Clustering: O(t¬≤) for similarity calculations (with early termination)
- History update: O(t) with O(1) Map lookups

**Memory Usage**:
- Each topic stores: mentions array, articles array, scores
- History limited to 24 data points per topic
- Automatic cleanup of stale topics (> 24 hours)
- Estimated: ~1-2MB for 1000 active topics

**Time Windows**:
- Short (1h): Real-time trending detection
- Medium (4h): Acceleration/deceleration detection
- Long (24h): Daily trend tracking

## üéØ Real-World Example

Using test data, the AI topic:
- **9 mentions** across 16 articles
- **7.0 mentions/hour** velocity (very high)
- **0.922 trend score** (excellent - top trending)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Velocity: 1.000 (maxed out - very fast)
  - Volume: 0.900 (high volume)
  - Recency: 0.822 (very recent)
  - Credibility: 0.877 (high quality sources)
- **Sources**: TechNews (0.95), BBC (0.98), Reuters (0.97), Guardian (0.92), TechCrunch (0.90), BlogSpot (0.30)
- **Lifecycle**: Emerging (newly detected, high confidence)

## üöÄ Usage Example

```javascript
import TrendingService from './services/analytics/trendingService.js';

const trendingService = new TrendingService({
  minMentions: 3,
  minVelocity: 0.5,
});

const articles = [/* array of article objects */];

const analysis = trendingService.analyzeTrending(articles, {
  limit: 20,
  includeLifecycle: true,
  includeClusters: true,
});

console.log(`Found ${analysis.trending.length} trending topics`);
console.log(`Top topic: ${analysis.trending[0].keyword}`);
console.log(`Velocity: ${analysis.trending[0].velocity.toFixed(2)} mentions/hour`);
console.log(`Trend score: ${analysis.trending[0].trendScore.toFixed(3)}`);
console.log(`Lifecycle: ${analysis.trending[0].lifecycle.stage}`);
console.log(`Clusters: ${analysis.clusters.length}`);
```
