## 📰 News Aggregation Legal Requirements

### **1. Copyright Law & Fair Use**

#### **U.S. Copyright Law (17 U.S.C. § 107)**

**Fair Use Factors:**
1. **Purpose and character of use** - Transformative, commentary, news reporting
2. **Nature of copyrighted work** - Factual works have weaker protection
3. **Amount and substantiality** - Limited excerpts, not full articles
4. **Effect on market value** - Should not substitute for original

**DigitalTide Compliance Strategy:**
- ✅ **Transformative Use**: AI analyzes multiple sources and creates original content
- ✅ **Limited Excerpts**: Never reproduce full articles from sources
- ✅ **Attribution**: Always credit original sources with links
- ✅ **Added Value**: Provide analysis, synthesis, and unique perspectives

#### **Safe Harbor Provisions (17 U.S.C. § 512)**

**Requirements for DMCA Safe Harbor Protection:**
1. Designate a DMCA agent with U.S. Copyright Office
2. Implement takedown procedures for infringing content
3. Terminate repeat infringers
4. No actual knowledge of infringement
5. No financial benefit directly attributable to infringement

**DigitalTide Implementation:**
- Register DMCA agent: `dmca@digitaltide.com`
- Automated content review and flagging system
- Clear takedown request process
- Three-strike policy for contributors (if applicable)

## 🤖 AI-Generated Content Legal Considerations

### **1. AI Authorship & Copyright**

**Attribution Standard**:
```

Sources: [List of original sources]
```

**DigitalTide Risk Mitigation**:
- Use commercially licensed AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Liability transferred to AI provider under their terms
- Indemnification clauses in AI service agreements
- Document all AI usage and human oversight

### **3. Defamation & AI-Generated Claims**

**Legal Risk**: AI may generate false or defamatory statements

- ✅ Clear corrections policy
- ✅ Liability insurance for media operations
