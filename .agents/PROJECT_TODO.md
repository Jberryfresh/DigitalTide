# DigitalTide - Project TODO List

> **Instructions for AI Agent**: This TODO list represents the complete development roadmap for DigitalTide from inception to launch. Each phase builds upon the previous one. Follow the order strictly, completing all tasks in a phase before moving to the next. Mark completed tasks with `[✓]` and current work with `[🔄]`. Add detailed notes under each completed task for future reference.

## 🌳 BRANCHING & PULL REQUEST STRATEGY

### **Branch Creation Rules (REVISED - Industry Best Practice):**
- **Create a new branch for each PHASE INCREMENT** (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 - NOT entire Phase 2)
- **Branch naming**: `phase-{number}.{increment}-{description}` 
  - Examples: `phase-2.1-database-setup`, `phase-2.2-api-development`, `phase-2.3-agent-framework`
- **Complete ONE increment per branch** - do not mix multiple increments
- **Smaller, focused changes** = easier reviews, faster feedback, less merge conflicts

### **Pull Request Workflow:**
1. **Start Increment**: Create new branch from `main` (e.g., `phase-2.1-database-setup`)
2. **Work Through Increment**: Complete all tasks within that specific increment (2.1, 2.2, etc.)
3. **Commit Frequently**: Make small, logical commits for each completed task
4. **Increment Complete**: When ALL tasks in the increment are done, create PR for review
5. **Get Approval**: Wait for human review and approval
6. **Merge & Cleanup**: Merge to main, delete feature branch
7. **Next Increment**: Create NEW branch for next increment (e.g., `phase-2.2-api-development`)

### **Commit Message Format:**
```
[PHASE-X.Y] Task description - Priority Level

Examples:
[PHASE-2.1] Set up PostgreSQL database schema - P1
[PHASE-2.2] Implement JWT authentication system - P1  
[PHASE-2.3] Create AgentMessage protocol and BaseAgent class - P1
```

### **Benefits of Increment-Per-Branch Strategy:**
- ✅ **Faster Reviews**: Smaller PRs are easier to review thoroughly
- ✅ **Reduced Risk**: Can test and validate each increment independently
- ✅ **Better Rollback**: Easier to revert specific changes if needed
- ✅ **Clear Progress**: Each merge represents a concrete milestone
- ✅ **Less Merge Conflicts**: Smaller changesets = fewer conflicts
- ✅ **Continuous Integration**: Deploy and test after each increment

### **Example Branch Strategy:**
```
main
├── phase-2.1-database-setup → merge → delete
├── phase-2.2-api-development → merge → delete
├── phase-2.3-agent-framework → merge → delete
├── phase-2.4-testing-infrastructure → merge → delete
├── phase-3.1-coo-agent → merge → delete
├── phase-3.2-crawler-agent → merge → delete
└── phase-3.3-writer-agent → merge → delete
```

> **Remember**: One increment = One branch = One PR. Keep scope tight and focused. This approach follows industry standards used by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech leaders.
