# Project Ideas / Features

## Project Workflow

- use github workflows, to automate commits, issues, and pull requests.



## Site Content

- Have multiple sites, RSS feeds, API's that an agent will be collecting news articles from, in order to research and understand what the trending topics are at that moment.

- Only collect in ways and from sources that isnt frowned upon, legal, and will not get the site in trouble or banned in any way.

- Have multiple different catagories for articles.

- On the Articles card, have it display, the estimated reading time, along with ang image that relates to the article. (an AI generated image that our team of agents created.)

- At the bottem of an article, we should have links to other articles that are related to the current article. This will hopefully help the user find more articles related to what they are interested in, as well as keep them on the site longer, looking at more of our content.

- Nowhere on the site should it mention or suggest that any of the content on the site is generated by AI. I would like to keep the vibe and the users thinking that all of the content is created by humans. Without lieing to them in any sort of way.

- Each article will need to be a certain length that resembles regular articles from other sites. We dont want them being to short, or extremly long, unless absolutly needed and first approved by a human.

- **Timelines:** When an article is part of an ongoing story that we have previous articles on. Somewhere on the page that the article being read about, we should ad some sort of dynamic visual of a timeline with links to the other articles that are part of the same ongoing storyline.

- We should implement a feature, where there is a button at the beggining of the article, probably under the title, but above the article content, for  AI to read the article to you, for people who are busy and arent able to stare at their phone for and extended period of time, and would help them by listening to it instead.

- **Geographic Content** Im not entirely sure how this would be implemented... but we should gather information from the sites visitors that gives us a general idea of their location, specifically so that they can have a "local" genre of news incase they are interested in viewing that. Might be difficult creating local articles from everywhere though, but something to think about.
